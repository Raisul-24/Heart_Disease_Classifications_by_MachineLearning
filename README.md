"# Heart_Disease_Classifications_by_MachineLearning" 

Heart Disease Classification mainly data mining related work. Data Mining
task has two branches such as-Predictive Method another one Descriptive
Method. Again predictive method has some types mainly classification, Regression,
Deviation Detection. Here, we mainly use classification algorithm such as-
Logistics Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree classification. Here we
maintain some step or rules, firstly data selection then data prepossessing again
data transform to target transformed data. After transformed data we mining data
and convert into some pattern. Finally, Evaluate data using algorithm and find or
gain knowledge or output. We did following every step for this project. At the end
of the project, We tried to compare the accuracy of all the algorithms used.
